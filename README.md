# Bitso Price Ticker
Scripts that are part of a a bigger master plan. 

Right now is just getting the Bitso prices and inserting them in a spreadsheet on Google Drive

Have fun :D

UPDATE:
Now it can decide whether it should buy or sell depending of two moving averages created from the price history.
